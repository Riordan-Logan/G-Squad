# Introduction
Scope and purpose of document (<PL>)
In one paragraph, describe what is contained in this document and the general
purpose of a Project Plan. In a separate paragraph, provide an overview of
your application.

This is a project plan for the Reddit website and application. Reddit is a community-based forum site that allows users to create their own category of threads in an easy-to-access and organized manner. The purpose of this project plan is to outline the scope and goals of the Reddit platform. It will explain what "Reddit" is and describe the website's functionality. Along with that, it will be providing a framework for the development of the platform along with additional enhancements to make the website as user-friendly as possible. 

# System Scope
Problem/Opportunity Description
In 1-2 paragraphs, describe what the goal is of your project. What problem
are you trying to solve or what opportunity are you trying to take advantage
of?

The goal of Reddit is to provide a platform for open discussion to many communities worldwide. What this means is that we want to give users the ability to publish "threads,” which are self-published articles with a heading and body of text, into a hub with a like-minded interest, which are called "Subreddits.” To further facilitate discussion, users are encouraged to publish comments to these threads, which are small text boxes at the bottom of the thread. Comments can be replied to by other users to have deeper conversations and more focused discussions. This grants people, whether in large communities or more niche ones, a voice that can be seen and heard worldwide. Allowing ideas and information to be spread to anyone, anywhere. This also grants different cultures, fandoms, hobbyists, etc., the capability to gather with each other from many parts of the world. 

# Anticipated Business/Personal Benefits
In one paragraph, describe what your company will hope to achieve by creating
this application. In another paragraph, describe the benefits to the users.

Now, what does the company achieve by creating such an app? Being a platform for many different communities, advertisers would take a great interest in their target audience. Not only providing the user with ads they are more interested in but also increasing the effectiveness of companies' advertisements now that they can have a higher likelihood that whoever is seeing it is going to dive further into it. Not to mention heavy users of the app could be interested in buying premium memberships and other bonuses. This premium membership can increase the user's dedication to the website, thereby also increasing their activity on the platform, which would stir up more convos and increase engagement. 

So, how does this benefit users? Reddit thrives off of activity and discussion. People thrive off having an outlet to share their thoughts and feelings. Whether it is rambling on about something you're passionate about or needing to get your voice out there on a subject that has been troubling you, Reddit wants to provide users the ability to have that voice. Users benefit by being able to search for a community of their interest and immediately provide their input right after account creation. Also, they are given the ability to create a community subreddit to further promote and give a platform to their interest. 

# System Capabilities
List of major functions of the system. These are taken from the Project
Proposal and expanded upon.

Reddit is planned to be a community forum website. As a public website meant to gather people to spread ideas, it is important to keep it organized. A Subreddit is a dedicated space within Reddit that a specific subject can be focused on. Within these subreddits are where threads can be posted. Threads, comments, and replies have an "upvote" and "downvote" button. These buttons change the positioning of the thread either closer to the top or bottom of the page, depending on its importance.
